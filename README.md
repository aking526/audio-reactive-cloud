## Credits
- This website was built on top of the [Next.js and Supabase Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/authentication/supabase) by Vercel.
- The audio processing techniques used in this project were built on top of my original [Audio Processing Studio](https://github.com/alistairking/audio-processing-studio). I wrote that project for my final project for my CS class in senior year of high school; it was a barebones version of this project, without the ability to login, save projects, etc.
