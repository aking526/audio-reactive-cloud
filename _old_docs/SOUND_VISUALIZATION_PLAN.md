## Technical Implementation

### Audio Data Flow

```
Audio File → Web Audio API → AnalyserNode → AudioAnalyzer
                                       ↓
Tone.js Analysis → Feature Extraction → Visualization Components
                                       ↓
Real-time Data → React Three Fiber → 3D Scene Updates
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Data Throttling**: Limit analysis updates to 60fps
2. **Object Pooling**: Reuse Three.js objects to prevent GC
3. **LOD (Level of Detail)**: Reduce complexity at distance
4. **Instancing**: Use THREE.InstancedMesh for repeated objects
5. **Worker Threads**: Move heavy computations off main thread

### State Management

```typescript
interface VisualizationState {
  currentVisualization: 'bars' | 'sphere' | 'particles' | 'tunnel' | 'lattice' | 'liquid';
  audioFeatures: AudioFeatures;
  isPlaying: boolean;
  settings: {
    sensitivity: number;
    smoothing: number;
    colorScheme: 'rainbow' | 'fire' | 'ocean' | 'neon';
    quality: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'ultra';
  };
}
```
