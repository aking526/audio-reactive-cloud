## Getting Started with Audio

The Audio Reactive Cloud studio provides two ways to get started with audio processing:

### 1. Upload Your Own Audio File

Click on the **Upload File** tab and drag & drop your audio file or click to browse. Supported formats include:
- MP3
- WAV 
- OGG
- M4A
- AAC
- FLAC

You can also download an mp3 sample song from the [`mp3-files` folder](./mp3-files).

### 2. Use Sample Songs

Click on the **Sample Songs** tab to choose from our curated collection of sample audio files. This is perfect for:
- Testing the platform without uploading your own files
- Experimenting with different audio characteristics
- Quick demonstrations

Simply click "Select" next to any sample song to load it into the audio player.

## Audio Effects

Once you've loaded an audio file (either uploaded or from samples), you can apply various effects:

- **Pitch Shift**: Adjust the pitch up or down by semitones
- **Speed Control**: Change playback speed from 0.5x to 1.5x
- **Bass Boost**: Enhance low frequencies with adjustable gain

## Saving Projects

You can save your audio projects with all applied effects settings. Saved projects can be:
- Updated with new effect settings
- Copied to create variations
- Loaded later to continue working
